The main.c program is a test driver for logLib.c. Compile the code using the Makefile and the corresponding a.out can be used with the follow options:
-a : the program will use perror to send out an error message resulting from code designed to have an error as an example. 
-m [message] : -m "message here" will send the user specified message to be recorded in the log. 

recommended usage: a.out -am "my message"

The error messages follow the format specified in the assignment file but with time info of the log preceeding it as suggested by the text the assignment is based around. 

Following the printing of the entire log for the program, the log will be saved to a file name log.txt in the working directory. 

GitHub was used for version control. To see change log, use 'git log'. Cloned repository from working directory so .git/logs will not show all commit messages.
